# How can you contribute to OpenPlanetaryMap (OPM) ?

Hey! you've made it to this page... Nice, maybe you can help. :)

We recently made public a first draft version of our OPM vector-based basemap of Mars ([OPM Mars Basemap v0.1](https://github.com/openplanetary/opm/wiki/OPM-Mars-Basemap-v0.1)).
Please raise any [issues](https://github.com/openplanetary/opm/issues) (or improvements) related to the design and usability of this basemap. That would help us improving it.

If you like the OpenPlanetaryMap project we can follow us on Twitter [@opmteam](https://twitter.com/opmteam).
You can tweet your home-browed maps using our OPM basemap with the #OpenPlanetaryMap hashtag.

Thanks!
